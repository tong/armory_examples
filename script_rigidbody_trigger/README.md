## RigidBody trigger (sphere object)
- Rigid body set to:
    - Active dynamic
    - Axis and rotation locked (linear and angular factor)
    - Trigger/Ghost checked making this a trigger instead of a collision object
    - Force deactivation unchecked to make sure physics engine keep the rigid body active
- Trigger script checks for overlapping rigid bodies on each update

## How to test
Move the box around using WSAD+QE.
When box is overlapping sphere the icoshpere object is visible, otherwise it's hidden.
